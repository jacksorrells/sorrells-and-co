At Sorrells & Company, we master the art of designing and building a new home that addresses our clients’ individual wants, needs and dreams. It’s this Design + Build mindset that is the essence of what differentiates Sorrells & Co. from other builders in Central Texas. Proven processes, systems and efficiencies ensure reduced timelines and no surprises. Transparency of costs associated with your project ensures the lines of communication with clients are always open.

Likewise, Sorrells Development communities deliver a life-enhancing vision. Riverside is Waco’s first master planned, lifestyle community developed on the 120-acre Sorrells family farm. Then came Badger Ranch, a mixed-use development, complete with resort-style amenities centered around spring-fed lakes. Cameron Heights is the realization of our vision to build homes in an urban infill neighborhood near Waco’s flourishing downtown and Brazos River corridor.

Steve Sorrells founded Sorrells Development Corporation in 1998, and Sorrells & Gunn launched a year later. Today, Sorrells & Co. represents the latest generation in the evolution of home building in Central Texas. Sorrells has a successful history of blending currents trends, timeless design and individual demands of new homebuyers. In addition to a reputation for differing and distinct styles and lifestyle-centric communities, Sorrells’ companies lead the industry in energy efficiency and green building technologies.
