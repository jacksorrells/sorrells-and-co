### Transparency / Communication

Transparency/Communication — The lines of ongoing communication between clients and Sorrells & Co. are purposefully open.

Simply by logging on via your smartphone or handheld device, clients see the positive impact of their decisions using our Co-Construct® system.

### Design + Build

    Design + Build

Starting with the end in mind, together we discuss your goals — likes and preferences, budgets and timelines. We create a course of action (plans & specifications) to achieve these goals, and we revisit the goals along the way (budget review) to ensure these goals are met. Our in house design team creates an imaginative and personalized plan based on our information gathering meeting, and utilizes a straight forward communication style to assure Sorrells & Company will design + build a home that you wish to afford, while meeting your wants, needs and dreams.

### Systemic Approach

Sorrells & Co.’s management of each home-building project makes the process enjoyable for our clients. Our systematic approach includes Design + Build, budgeting sessions, Gantt charts, purchase authorizations, Sage/Master Builder accounting system and our Co-Construct communication system. We work to strike the perfect balance of reporting the details with creating a work of art that is all part of building your new home. Our clients have real-time access to the status of their project, including budgets, selections and scheduling. Because of this underlying foundation of systems, we have found our clients experience a greater sense of satisfaction during their home-building process.

### Integrity / No Surprises

The structural integrity of the houses we build are as important as the integrity of our team. What we build must perform to our client’s satisfaction. Our team promises to be honest and fair in all dealings with our clients.
